Welcome to the video on the multiplicative axis, a new approach to navier stokes with prime number gates. This framework offers a way to address challenges in physicsinformed neural networks. Traditional additive PINNs suffer from gradient pathology where data loss and physics loss gradients conflict. This orthogonal conflict leads to data dominance which smooths out physics features and results in unresolved dynamics and instability. The multiplicative axis introduces a paradigm shift. Instead of additive competition, we use multiplicative gating. The physics penalty acts as a lens, modulating the data loss and promoting manifold adherence, transforming the loss function. The multiplicative axis hypothesis suggests gating enables an automatic curriculum. This process moves from a validity phase focusing on physics alignment to a fidelity phase allowing for unconstrained data assimilation ensuring stability and high frequency capture. The Oiler product gate provides prime indexed attenuation. Each constraint is mapped to a distinct prime number creating hierarchical orthogonality analogous to unique prime factorization minimizing gradient cross talk. The framework uses an exponential barrier and a forward pass mechanism. Critical violations trigger an exponential barrier acting as a soft hard wall. The forward pass selects the dominant factor ensuring robust physics enforcement and stability. The implementation logic referred to as crystal uses core components like the oiler product gate for attenuation and the exponential barrier for amplification. This dynamically modulates data loss for stable convergence. The open- source multiplicative pin framework includes the core multiplicative pin module, a prime scheduler for control, and a Navier Stokes validator suite. It is a drop-in replacement for standard physics loss. Our methodological evolution shifts from wavelets to primes. Similar to how wavelets decompose function space into scales, the multiplicative axis uses number theoretic basis for complexity, scalability, and constraint space. Validation shows significant stability improvements. While additive PINNs diverge quickly, the multiplicative pin remains stable for over 8,000 steps, achieving a 99.64% residual reduction. Spectral analysis confirms vortex preservation. The multiplicative framework preserves high frequencies and small scale features, capturing sharp vortices, retaining three times more energy and high wave numbers than the standard formulation. gradient fighting is suppressed. Streamlined visualizations exhibit mathematical continuity and monotonic pressure decay, confirming that pressure velocity coupling no longer produces disconnected vector fields. This work unifies control theory, number theory and deep learning, evolving blind optimization into guided evolution. This promises stable surrogates for complex flows impacting areas like climate modeling and fusion plasma stability. Future extensions include 3D large EDI simulation, adaptive prime allocation via reinforcement learning, and hardware acceleration using a quote physics router for efficient computation.
